# Crypto Exchanges: Complete Guide to Trading Platforms

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms where you can buy, sell, and trade digital assets. Choosing the right exchange is crucial for your security, costs, and trading experience. This guide covers everything you need to know about crypto trading platforms.

## Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Traditional platforms operated by companies that facilitate trading between users. They hold custody of user funds and operate like digital brokerages.

Blockchain-based platforms where users trade directly with each other using smart contracts, maintaining control of their funds throughout the process.

**Hybrid Exchanges:**
Platforms combining features of both centralized and decentralized models, offering various trade-offs between convenience and control.

Services that connect buyers and sellers directly, facilitating trades without holding user funds during the transaction process.
