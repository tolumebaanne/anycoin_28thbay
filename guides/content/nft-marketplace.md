# NFT Marketplace Guide: Digital Ownership and Non-Fungible Tokens

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital ownership certificates stored on blockchain networks. Unlike cryptocurrencies where each token is identical, every NFT is distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another.

## Understanding NFTs

**What Makes NFTs Different:**
- **Fungible**: Bitcoin, dollars - each unit identical and interchangeable
- **Non-Fungible**: NFTs, real estate - each unit unique with different properties
- **Digital Uniqueness**: Blockchain proves authenticity and ownership
- **Smart Contract**: Defines properties, royalties, and transfer rules

**How NFTs Work:**
NFTs are smart contracts containing metadata that points to digital assets. The blockchain stores ownership records and transaction history, creating provable digital scarcity.

**Common Misconceptions:**
- NFTs don't always store the actual digital file on blockchain
- Buying an NFT doesn't always grant copyright ownership
- NFT ownership doesn't prevent copying of digital content
- Value comes from provable ownership, not access restriction

## Types of NFTs
